3. Message from Creator

Hi, I'm John. As of writing this, I am 16-years-old, and I am from the
suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, USA. In my freetime, I am passionate for
developing and programming games and apps.

I originally wrote this program to help resize a sprite for a game I was
working on, and have decided to release it to the general public.

To my game designers, I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me.
And to everyone else, I hope you also find good use for it.

If you have any issues with it or have some suggestions for the code,
please feel free to reach out to me. My email is johnfioregames@gmail.com.

Thank you, and enjoy.

John Fiore
